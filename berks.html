					<h2>Blue Marsh Lake</h2>
					<p>Blue Marsh Lake is a man made lake created by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1974.  It encompasses 1150 acres of water and is surrounded by a large amount publicly accessible park land.  Trails criss cross this blend of forest and meadows.  The main trail is a 30 mile loop that circles the lake.  A part of the trail is handicap accessible.  The area is good for horseback riding, hiking, biking, and a variety of water sports.</p>

					<h2>Mt. Penn/Pagoda Area</h2>
					<p>Mt. Penn rises majestically behind the Reading skyline.  While the Pagoda is a great landmark and attraction, the area around it is criss crossed with many trails.  Hikers, mountain bikers and runners can explore many miles of trails and appreciate great views of the city of Reading.  Beware that many of the trails have moderate to difficult terrain and may not always be clearly marked.</p>

					<h2>Schuylkill River Trail (Berks County Segment)</h2>
					<p>Stretching 130 miles from Auburn in Schuylkill County to Philadelphia, the Schuylkill River Trail is a blend of roads and trails that generally follows the path of the Schuylkill River.  The Berks County section is mostly road in northern Berks County, but is mostly off road starting at the dam at Blue Marsh Lake and extending towards Pottstown in Montgomery County.  The road sections are good for cyclists, but may not be good for hikers and walkers.  The trail sections offer good views of Schuylkill River.  The trail is managed by a number of different organizations and municpalities.</p>

				<h2>What's up with the Pagoda?</h2>
				
				<p>
					The Pagoda is clearly visible along Mt. Penn above the Reading skyline.  It was built by William A. Witman, Sr. in 1908 to be a luxury resort, but due to financial difficulties, never became a resort.  It is now owned by the City of Reading and is open to the public for tours and can be rented for events.  On Christmas Eve, the lights on the Pagoda flash to indicate that Santa Claus has arrived.
