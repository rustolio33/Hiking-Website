					<h2>Perkiomen Trail</h2>
					<p>This 20 mile trail runs from the Schulkill River Trail in Oaks to the Green Lane Borough.  It is partly paved and partly gravel.  It was created as a rails to trails project turning the Perkiomen Line of the Reading Railroad into a public access trail.  It is good for walkers, cyclists and runners and is relatively flat.  The trail runs along the Perkiomen Creek and offers beautiful views of the creek in various spots.</p>

					<h2>Schuylkill River Trail (Montgomery County segment)</h2>
					<p>Stretching 130 miles from Auburn in Schuylkill County to Philadelphia, the Schuylkill River Trail is a blend of roads and trails that generally follows the path of the Schuylkill River.  The first Montgomery County segment starts at the Berks County line and goes east until Pottstown where it crosses the Schulkill River and dips into Chester County.  The trail comes back into Montgomery County in Mont Clare and continues along the Schulkill River through Valley Forge National Park and continues into Philadelphia.</p>

					<h2>Upper Schulkill Valley Park</h2>
					<p>This 15 acre park next to the Schulkill River has a number of attractions for animal lovers.  For hikers, a trail starts at the lower parking lot and continues along the river to Schuykill Canal Park in Mont Clare.  A number of small trails branch off the main trail and loop through the woods above the river, as well as connect to neighborhoods nearby.  The trails are accessible to hikers, trail runners and mountain bikers.  Along the main trail, hikers can view a dam as well as locks.</p>

				<h2>Rails to Trails</h2>
				
				<p>
					"Rails to trails" is a term describing the process of converting unused railways to public access trails for walking and biking.  The Rails to Trails Conserancy estimates that there are more than 30,000 miles of rail trails in the United States.  Converting railways to trails makes good use of the space and promotes healthy communities.  Many of the rails to trails projects in the US are based on <em>railbanking</em> which preserves the space for future use as a railroad if economic conditions change.  Meanwhile, the trails provide access to the outdoors for many people.
