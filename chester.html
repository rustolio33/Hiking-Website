					<h2>Chester Valley Trail</h2>
					<p>Stretching from Exton to Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County, the Chester Valley trail provides a place for walkers, runners and cyclists to enjoy the outdoors.  It was built on an abandoned railway and is very flat and paved.  The trail is paved and is handicap accessible.  A number of parks connect to the trail.  Plans are to connect the trail to the Schuylkill River Trail.</p>

					<h2>Schuylkill River Trail (Chester County segment)</h2>
					<p>Stretching 130 miles from Auburn in Schuylkill County to Philadelphia, the Schuylkill River Trail is a blend of roads and trails that generally follows the path of the Schuylkill River.  The Chester County section starts where the trail crosses the Schuylkill River from Montgomery County south of Pottstown and continues through northern Chester County to Phoenixville.  It is on roads from Pottstown to Parkerford where it then follows an abandoned railroad to Phoenixville.  From there it crosses the Schuylkill River back into Montgomery County</p>
