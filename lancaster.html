					<img src="images\websusq.jpg" alt="Dam near Chickies Rock" class="parks" />
					<p>Chickies Rock County Park is along the Susquehanna River in western Lancaster County near Marietta.  It consists of more than 422 acres.  The most prominent feature, Chickies Rock, is a 100 foot rock outcropping overlooking the mighty Susquehanna River.  A number of trails run through the park including the 14 mile Northwestern Lancaster County River Trail.</p>

					<h2>Money Rocks County Park</h2>
					<p>Money Rocks County Park is along the Welsh Mountain ridge in eastern Lancaster County.  It is 300 acres and has miles of moderate to difficult trails that are good for hikers, trail runners and horseback riders.  The park is named for the rock outcropping that overlooks the bucolic farmland of eastern Lancaster County.  The rock outcropping is a short hike from the parking lot, but don't miss the miles of trails west of the outcropping.</p>

					<h2>Tucquan Glen</h2>
					<img src="images\tucquanglen.jpg" alt="Creek flowing through Tucquan Glen" class="parks" />
					<p>Managed by the Lancaster County Conservancy, Tucquan Glen is a 336 acre preserve that offers beautiful views of a stream that cuts through a ravine on it's final plunge to the Susquehanna River.  A trailhead along with an abandoned road offer a 2.4 mile circuit that runs from the trailhead to the end of the park near the Susquehanna River.  The trail connects to the 63 mile Conestoga Trail along the river.</p>

				<h2>Money in the Rocks?</h2>
				
				<p>
					Rumor has it that during the Civil War, farmers hid their money in the rocks along this ridge when the Confederate soldiers started marching through Pennsylvania.  No money has ever been reported to being found, but Money Rocks County Park offers beautiful views and many miles of hiking.
